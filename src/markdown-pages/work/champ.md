# Overview

I started off at Champion Data Systems (Champ) as a contractor before they eventually hired me as an application developer. As the only employee, I had a broad variety of projects. I worked mostly as a developer, and occasionally did ux and marketing duties.

# Development

When I started working for Champ, they were running a monolithic stack based on metal servers. My boss tasked us with developing the second generation of the platform utilizing microservices and deployed in the cloud.

We started from the ground up and completely rebuilt the platform. My boss and I did the planning, and I wrote most of the code. The structure was primarily node.js based with CI/CD pipelines 

## Agenda Management v2

Champ has an agenda management app that runs on the old PHP stack, but it lacks modern responsiveness, features, and development flexibility. The goal was to build a new application from the ground up.

I was involved in the customer interviews, planning, and ui design.

## Graphics

Champ had a lot of requests from customers for a simple digital signage solution in addition to their video packages. Utilizing socket.io, I built a solution for realtime control of a Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode.
