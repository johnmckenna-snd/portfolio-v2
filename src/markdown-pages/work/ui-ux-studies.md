# Overview

To learn more about UI/UX, I have done a couple studies where I looked at aa problem and mocked up a solution app or page.

# Captains Log

Captains Log was a concept that my former boss came up with: a need to log website links with just a bit more information that can be provided by bookmarks alone. I made a mockup of what perhaps the UI could look like.

# Dudes Eat

My former roomate and I came up with the idea for Dudes Eat as an open source food blog. The idea is that the code will be posted on Github and anyone can contribute via pull request. There will be people to cook and approve the merge of a new recipe.

# Kairos

Kairos was my first UI/UX study. I really enjoy cooking, and I wanted to have multiple timers going at once in single app. I couldn't find one that I really like so decided to design one.

Over a year ago, I attempted to build it, but my development skills weren't good enough. I had trouble managing multiple timers in React. I would like to revisit it soon using a context a central store for the timers now that my development skills have significantly improved.
