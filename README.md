# portfolio-v2

Hello and welcome to my portfolio version 2. It's the second version so you know things are getting real. I made the repo public so anyone who is interested can take a peek!

It's a Gatsby site. This was my first time using Gatsby, and I have to say the dev experience was very pleasant.

## run it

```
npm i
gatsby develop
```
